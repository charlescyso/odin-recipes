My favorite recipes!
Here are some of my favorite recipes to make!

Reflection:

It's been over a month since I've worked on this project, but I figured I would go through my old projects so I can write some reflections down while my memory is still there. I believe this is my first time in a long time building a website in html, the last time being in 2015-2016 when I took an intro to computer science class. I have little recollection of what I learnt in that class, so it was nice to refresh on some of my learning through this project. I think I retained more information too since I was learning for myself and not for a course in university just to get a passing grade. Nonetheless, I went with a very simple layout, very little to do with CSS because I hadn't reached that point. I didn't really go beyond what was required since I knew I would eventually cross that bridge in the future. I just chose a couple of my favorite recipes. In hindsight, I could've perhaps centered the elements onto the page and it would make it more exciting despite having little to no css. Good start, Charles!
